# jader_docker

MySQL-Docker for Japanese Adverse Drug Event Report database (UNOFFICIAL)

# What's JADER

JADER (Japanese Adverse Drug Event Report) is a database of spontaneous reporting of adverse frug reactions  in Japan. Anyone can download it from the website of [Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA)](https://www.pmda.go.jp/english/about-pmda/outline/0005.html), which is Japanese regulatory agency, working together with Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare in Japan.

JADER dataset is composed of four csv files, regarding DEMO table (patient gender, age, weight, etc.), DRUG table (drug name, causality of drug, etc.), REAC table (adverse drug reaction name, outcome, etc.), and HIST table (medical history). There are NOT including standardized classification codes such as MedDRA code, ICD-10 code, ATC code. Data are described in Japanese and the character set of those csv files is [Shift JIS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shift_JIS).

Here, we developed docker-compose.yml and other some configulation files for setting MySQL with JADER dataset. 

# how to use it
## 1. Download JADER csv files
- Access [JADER download page](https://www.pmda.go.jp/safety/info-services/drugs/adr-info/suspected-adr/0005.html) on PMDA web site
  - only available in Japanese
  - need to agree with PMDA's terms and conditions
  - Jader-mysal-docker is NOT developed by PMDA, and bear NO relation with PMDA
- Download complete datasets of JADER from download page
  - PMDA updates it monthly, so you need to download it NOW.
  - The character set is Shift JIS code, and please NOT transcode it.
  - jader_docker needs csv files listed as below, and you NEED to rename them before the next step:
    - demoYYYYMM.csv, and rename it to **demo.csv**
    - drugYYYYMM.csv, and rename it to **drug.csv**
    - histYYYYMM.csv, and rename it to **hist.csv**
    - reacYYYYMM.csv, and rename it to **reac.csv**

## 2. Deploy jader_docker
### Clone Jader-mysql-docker
~~~
$ git clone https://github.com/haRimi-epi/Jader-mysql-docker.git
$ cd ./Jader-mysql-docker/
~~~

### Replace JADER csv files

- the repository has dummy files of JADER, so please replace them with downloaded and renamed by step 1.

~~~
$ ls ./init/jader/
demo.csv  drug.csv  hist.csv  reac.csv
~~~

### Build Jader-mysql-docker
~~~
$ docker-compose up -d
~~~

### check status

~~~
$ docker ps
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE          COMMAND                  CREATED          STATUS          PORTS                                                  NAMES
cfd6a2ad9081   mysql:latest   "docker-entrypoint.sâ€¦"   13 seconds ago   Up 12 seconds   0.0.0.0:3306->3306/tcp, :::3306->3306/tcp, 33060/tcp   mysql_jader
~~~

### :confetti_ball: congratulations!

Now, you can access and handle JADER via Docker-MySQL.
